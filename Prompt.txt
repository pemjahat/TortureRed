create CMake for my project with this specification.
- C++ Windows application as startup project
- Use SDL_Window to link static lib and dll
- Code structure based on this folder:
-- Bin - for all the compiled binary output
-- Build - for all intermediate build files
-- Content - for asset that will be used by application, example when load gltf it will be from this folder
-- ThirdParty - for all downloaded package like SDL, DXC
-- Sources - for all source codes, cpp, h, hlsl
- Add gitignore for these folders: Bin, Build, ThirdParty and Content
- No try catch, just assert directly
