Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. First action: repository discovery

Before editing, map these project. Use fast search commands similar to these, adjusted for the host shell and available tools:

```bash
pwd
git status --short
find . -maxdepth 3 -type f \( -iname "*path*trace*" -o -iname "*ray*trace*" -o -iname "*shader*" -o -iname "*.hlsl" -o -iname "*.hlsli" -o -iname "CMakeLists.txt" \) | sort
rg -n "PathTrace|PathTracer|Pathtracer|TraceRay|DispatchRays|DispatchRay|RayGen|closesthit|miss|bouncesMax|samplesPerPixel" .
rg -n "BindingSet|Descriptor|DescriptorSet|RootSignature|register\(|space[0-9]|UAV|SRV|StructuredBuffer|RWStructuredBuffer|ByteAddressBuffer" .
rg -n "ShaderTable|Pipeline|Permutation|Define|Macro|CompileShader|DXC|Slang|CMake|add_shader|shader compile" .
rg -n "SHARC|Sharc|HashGrid|NRC|NRD|RTXGI" .
```

Find these project-specific locations:

- build system files
- shader include directories
- shader permutation/define setup
- ray tracing pipeline creation
- shader binding table creation
- render loop or render graph pass scheduling
- output render target writing
- descriptor/register-space definitions
- global/per-frame constant buffer definitions
- existing debug UI, runtime settings, config files, and command-line parsing
- path tracer ray generation shader
- path tracing bounce loop
- material sampling and direct lighting evaluation
- denoiser input generation, if present
- GPU resource creation and clear/barrier helpers

## 2. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 3. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a expert engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 4. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 5. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

## 6. Documentation standards

> 📌 **Before creating ANY markdown document or Mermaid diagram, you MUST read the relevant style guide.** These are not optional — they define the formatting, structure, citation, accessibility, and visual standards for this project.

| Creating...                  | Read first                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Any `.md` document           | [markdown_style_guide.md](agentic/markdown_style_guide.md)                                                                     |
| Any Mermaid diagram          | [mermaid_style_guide.md](agentic/mermaid_style_guide.md), then the [specific type file](agentic/mermaid_diagrams/)             |

Key rules enforced by the style guides:

- **Diagrams** — `accTitle` + `accDescr` on every diagram, `classDef` color classes (no inline `style`), emoji on key nodes
- **Structure** — one H1, emoji on H2 only, no H5+, horizontal rules after `</details>` blocks
- **Everything is Code** — all markdown files in `docs/taskNNN-{short-descrption}.md`

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
