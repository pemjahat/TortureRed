create CMake for my project with this specification.
- C++ Windows application as startup project
- Use SDL_Window to link static lib and dll
- Code structure based on this folder:
-- Bin - for all the compiled binary output
-- Build - for all intermediate build files
-- Content - for asset that will be used by application, example when load gltf it will be from this folder
-- ThirdParty - for all downloaded package like SDL, DXC
-- Sources - for all source codes, cpp, h, hlsl
- Add gitignore for these folders: Bin, Build, ThirdParty and Content
- No try catch, just assert directly


Use directx12 API for this renderer, replace SDL renderer, but keep SDL Window.
Configure CMake to fetch DirectXHeaders and DXC and use it for this renderer.
For renderer follow this specification.
- Simple vertex and pixel shader to render Triangle, all under Sources/Shaders/
- Application will compile shader source with dxc and load it runtime
